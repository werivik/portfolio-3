                        <h3>1. Research & Requirement Gathering</h3>
                        <p>I start by understanding the project scope and gathering all necessary requirements. I work closely with the project manager, designers, and clients to ensure I fully understand the goals, user needs, and technical specifications.</p>
                        <p>I conduct research on the latest design trends, technologies, and tools that could be relevant to the project. I also look into competitors’ websites or apps to identify opportunities for improvement.</p>
                        <p>I clarify any functionality and features needed for the frontend, ensuring that everything is documented and clear before starting the development phase.</p>

                        <p>In collaboration with the design team, I review wireframes and prototypes, ensuring that the user experience (UX) is intuitive and the design is visually appealing.</p>
                        <p>I define the layout, structure, and interactions of the website or app. This includes planning the navigation, buttons, forms, and other interactive elements to ensure a smooth user flow.</p>
                        <p>I ensure that the design is responsive by implementing breakpoints and adapting layouts to various screen sizes, guaranteeing that the product looks great on all devices.</p>

                        <p>I set up the development environment, including version control, build tools, and task runners, to ensure an organized and efficient workflow.</p>
                        <p>I write clean, maintainable HTML, CSS (or Sass), and JavaScript to bring the design to life. I ensure that the code is modular and scalable for future updates and changes.</p>
                        <p>I implement responsive design principles by using media queries to ensure the website works across a variety of devices and screen sizes.</p>

                            <p>Hi there! I’m a 23 year old front-end developer who loves turning creative ideas into beautiful, functional websites. There’s something so exciting about starting with a blank page and watching it come to life through design and coding.</p>
                            <p>I really enjoy working with others—whether it’s brainstorming ideas, solving problems together, or just helping out a teammate. That said, I’m just as happy diving into solo projects where I can take charge and put my own stamp on things. Either way, I always put my best into everything I do and make unique websites each time.</p>
                            <p>At the heart of it all, I’m just someone who loves what they do and is always excited to learn and grow. Whether it’s tackling a new challenge or finding new ways to make a website shine, I’m always up for it!</p>

                            <h2>My Skills & Expertise</h2>
                            <p>During my studies, I built a strong foundation in front-end development, focusing on creating user interfaces that seamlessly merge customer experience with system development. I learned to develop products that not only look visually appealing but also deliver exceptional functionality and technical precision. My education emphasized a comprehensive approach, combining design processes, interaction design, and programming to prepare me for real-world challenges.</p>
                            <p>Throughout my time at school, I mastered key programming languages and frameworks, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind, Vite, and Bash. I also gained proficiency with essential tools for front-end development, such as Git, Cypress, Husky, and Github, to manage workflows and collaborate effectively. In addition to coding, I learned to work with industry-standard programs like Figma for design, Netlify for deployment, and Visual Studio Code for code editing and debugging.</p>
                            <p>My education was hands-on, with practical tasks that mirrored the challenges of the industry. These projects taught me how to optimize workflows, automate tasks, and streamline work processes to deliver high-quality results efficiently. I also explored the principles of entrepreneurship, gaining insight into the business side of development.</p>
                            <p>I would say the highlights of my education was the projects at the end of each semester. With these I had to be creative with the design and use everything I previously learned to my advantage.</p>
                            <p>Overall, my studies provided me with the theoretical knowledge and practical expertise needed to excel in a career as a front-end developer.</p>
